# q2d3

This is a prototype that illustrates how to use the QIIME 2 SDK to build an interface. This is based on the earlier [q2d2](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/q2d2) prototype. As this is a prototype, you shouldn't rely on any of the code in this package.

## Installation and usage

To try q2d3, check out the [Installing and using QIIME 2 demo](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/wiki/Installing-and-using-QIIME-2).
