# q2ui-q2d3

This is a prototype that illustrates how to use the QIIME 2 SDK to build an interface. This is based on the earlier [q2d2](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/q2d2) prototype. As this is a prototype, you shouldn't rely on any of the code in this package.

For a demo of this interface, see the [q2d3-interface-demo](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/q2d3-interface-demo) repository.
